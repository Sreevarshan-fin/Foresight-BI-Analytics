## Project Overview

Forggith Pharmaceuticals is a pharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution company operating across multiple regions and sales channels.
As the business grew, leadership found it increasingly difficult to track sales performance, target achievement, and market trends using existing reports.

This project focused on building a centralized Power BI dashboard that brings together **sales and marketing performance** into a single, easy-to-use view.
The aim was to move away from fragmented and manual reporting and provide a reliable analytics layer to support everyday business decisions.

---

## Business Context and Requirements

The business needed a reporting solution that could:

* Provide consistent visibility into sales and marketing KPIs
* Compare actual performance against defined targets
* Highlight top- and bottom-performing products, distributors, cities, and sales representatives
* Reduce dependency on verbal updates and manual data compilation

Sales data was collected monthly from distributors using a standardized format, making it possible to consolidate and analyze the data centrally.

---

## Analytical Scope

### Sales Performance Analysis

Sales performance was analyzed across several dimensions, including:

* Time (Year, Quarter, Month)
* Sales teams and individual representatives
* Product classes and individual products
* Sales channels and geographic locations

The dashboard tracked key metrics such as:

* Total revenue and revenue trends
* Year-to-date (YTD) performance and historical comparisons
* Actual revenue versus targets
* Month-on-month revenue growth
* Revenue contribution by channel, product class, and city

This analysis helped identify major revenue contributors, channel-level trends, and regional performance differences, including top- and bottom-performing cities.

---

### Marketing and Execution Performance

Marketing and execution effectiveness was evaluated using:

* Revenue achieved versus revenue targets
* Volume achieved versus volume targets
* Individual and team-level target achievement
* Revenue and volume contribution by sales representatives

The dashboard highlighted strong overall performance against targets, identified high-performing teams and individuals, and provided product-level insights comparing revenue and quantity trends across markets.

---

## Business Impact

The dashboard helped the business by:

* Providing clear and consistent visibility into sales and marketing performance
* Making it easier to identify growth opportunities and performance gaps
* Improving alignment between targets and execution
* Reducing the time spent on manual and ad-hoc reporting

Overall, the solution supported more structured performance tracking and better-informed decision-making.
